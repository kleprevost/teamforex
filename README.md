# #TeamForex

This is the code and analysis from the #teamforex project. See the below excerpt from Clemson's press release in 2012 around the project. This was a joint venture between Kyle LePrevost and Scott Cole at Clemson University. I'm posting this code for archival purposes - the methods, data, analysis, and code are no longer relevant to todays markets. 

"The students opened a “demo” brokerage account, using pretend money, to conduct practice trades and test their algorithm. It was a wildly successful experiment. Out of 58 trades made using the algorithm in spring 2012, only 13 moved in the opposite direction—a 77 percent prediction rate. The students began with $5,000 in their “dummy” account and ended up with $44,000 in theoretical funds just seven weeks later, a 780 percent increase.""
